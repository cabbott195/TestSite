            I was born and raised in the blazing hot state of Arizona. I have had a passion for computers ever since I first used one. I knew at a young age that I would want to do something with computers but was not sure what. I recently decided that coding was the right thing for me.

            My name is Colby Abbott and I am a web developer. Coding is something I am very passionate about. I love to see my work become something useful, that is something you get to see as a developer. I am extremely motivated to make the best websites I am capable of making.
